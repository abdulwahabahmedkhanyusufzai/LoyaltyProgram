# Loyalty Program Application Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation provides a non-technical overview of the Loyalty Program application, designed to help merchants reward their customers and encourage repeat purchases. The application consists of two main parts:
1.  **SaaS Admin Panel**: Where merchants configure the program, manage customers, and view analytics.
2.  **Shopify Storefront**: Where customers interact with the loyalty program, earn points, and redeem rewards.

## Part 1: SaaS Admin Panel (Merchant Guide)
The Admin Panel is your command center for the loyalty program. Here you can customize how the program works and track its success.

### 1. Dashboard & Analytics
Upon logging in, you are greeted with the Analytics Dashboard. This section gives you a quick snapshot of your program's health.
-   **Key Metrics**: View important data points such as total loyal customers, points issued, and points redeemed.
-   **Top Products**: Insights into your best-selling products among loyal customers.

### 2. Configuring the Loyalty Program
Navigate to the **Loyalty Program** section to set the rules of your program. This is the heart of the application.
-   **Conversion Rate**: Define how much a customer needs to spend to earn a point.
    -   *Example*: Set "€10 = 1 Point" to reward big spenders, or "€1 = 1 Point" for a more generous program.
-   **Tier Management**: Create different status levels (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold) to gamify the experience.
    -   **Customize Tiers**: You can rename tiers, assign custom colors to match your brand, and set the entry requirements.
-   **Advantages Table**: Clearly list the benefits for each tier.
    -   **Editable Rows**: You can add or modify benefits (rows) and check off which tiers receive them (e.g., "Free Shipping" might only be for Gold members).

### 3. Customer Management
In the **Loyal Customers** section, you can view a list of all customers participating in the program.
-   **Customer Profiles**: See individual customer details, including their current point balance and tier status.
-   **Manual Adjustments**: Administrators can manually add or remove customers from the loyalty program if necessary (e.g., for resolving disputes or special promotions).

### 4. Communications
-   **Email Settings**: Configure automated emails to keep customers engaged. This may include welcome emails when they join the program or notifications when they reach a new tier.

## Part 2: Shopify Storefront (Customer Experience)
This is what your customers will see on your online store. The application integrates seamlessly with your Shopify theme using "App Blocks".

### 1. Loyalty Dashboard
The **Loyalty Dashboard** is the primary interface for your customers.
-   **My Profile**: Displays the customer's current points balance and their achieved tier (e.g., "You are a Gold Member").
-   **Progress Tracking**: Shows how close they are to the next tier or reward.
-   **Available Rewards**: Lists the rewards they are currently eligible for based on their points.

### 2. Earning Points (Product Pages)
To encourage purchases, the **Product Points** block can be added to product pages.
-   **Instant Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays how many points a customer will earn by purchasing that specific product.
    -   *Example*: "Earn 12 points with this purchase!"
-   **Incentive**: Helps customers see the immediate value of buying higher-priced items.

### 3. Redeeming Points
The **Redemption Block** allows customers to spend their hard-earned points.
-   **Exchange Points**: Customers can exchange points for coupon codes or discounts directly on the store.
-   **Seamless Usage**: The redeemed discount code can be easily copied and applied at checkout.

### 4. Program Overview Page
You can add a **Loyalty Program Info** section to any page (like a "Rewards" landing page).
-   **Tier Breakdown**: Visually displays all available tiers (e.g., Welcomed, Guest, Host, Elite) and their respective point ranges.
-   **Benefits List**: clear bullet points showing what users get at every level (e.g., "20 points", "Free gifts").
-   **Static Offers**: Highlights standard offers like "Birthday Offer" or "Cashback rates" to entice new sign-ups.

## Getting Started Tips
-   **Start Simple**: Begin with a simple conversion rate (e.g., €1 = 1 Point) to avoid confusing customers.
-   **Test First**: Create a test customer account to walk through the earning and redeeming process yourself before launching.
-   **Promote It**: Use the "Product Points" block on your most popular items to boost awareness of the program.
